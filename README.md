This project is done for  [IVMOOC (Information Visualization Massively Open Online Course)](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/) class at Indiana University and The American Occupational Therapy Foundation client.

####Client Name:
Julie Bass, Director of Research, AOTF

### Project Description (goal/scientific or practical value):

[The American Occupational Therapy Foundation (AOTF)](http://aotf.org/) recently identified asset mapping of our scientists/researchers as a strategic goal for future research initiatives. At this time, we do not have a comprehensive understanding of our scientific community as is necessary for building scientific networks, identifying scientific leaders for specific initiatives, or summarizing our capacity to external stakeholder groups. A few years ago, a researcher database was launched with our partner, the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA). Before we proceed to larger asset mapping projects, it is timely to conduct analyses on the [existing researcher database](https://iu.box.com/s/wotjobq7j8wjh0dja7byj04d0cie1ok9). 

####Objectives:

Complete a temporal analysis and project analysis (diagnosis, ICF, categories) and identify times and project areas where there are bursts of activity.

Complete a geospatial analysis and map to identify potential collaboration links between institutions.

Complete a topical analysis using text associated with projects and researchers and map the evolving topic space.

Complete a network analysis and identify bimodal networks of experts and their institutions/expertise areas, projects and diagnosis/ICF/categories then visualize and animate these over time.

####Information on dataset(s) to be used: 

A summary of variables in the dataset include:
